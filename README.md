# Mojito
Mojito is a JavaScript framework, heavily inspired by Angular and Ember, which brings the benefits of components, services, ... to your (static) website.

## Status
We currently working very hard on developing the new Version 1.0 completely rewritten in TypeScript. 
If you want to use the older Version 0.5.5 go to the [https://github.com/thomaspink/mojito.js/tree/master](master branch).

## Building Mojito.js
1. Ensure that Node.js is installed.
2. Run `npm install` to ensure the required dependencies are installed.
3. Run `npm run build` to build Mojito.js. The builds will be placed in the dist/ directory.
