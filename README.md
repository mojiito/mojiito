  Mojiito
  <br>
  <br>
</h1>
Mojiito is a JavaScript framework, heavily inspired by Angular, which brings the benefits of components, services, ... to your (static) website.
It takes many usefull core concepts provided by Angular, like Dependency Injection or the component architecture, and makes it accessible through an Angular like API.

## What Mojiito is NOT
Mojiito is not a JavaScript framework for Web Applications. Use Angular, Ember, React, ... instead. Mojiito shines when used on your website where your DOM is already in place.

## Status
We currently working very hard on developing the new Version 2.0 completely rewritten in TypeScript. Mojiito is right now in Alpha State (2.0.0-alpha.3).

## Install
Run `npm install --save mojiito-core mojiito-platform-browser` in your command line tool.
