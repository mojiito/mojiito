# mojito
Lightweight Controller JS Framework

## What is it
mojito.js is just a little framework on top of [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) to better structurize your JavaScript for your (static) website.
- put controller on DOM Nodes
- the controller handles the JavaScript you need to write for that specific part and encapsulate it
- communicate with other controllers to make your application rich
- add actions/event to a DOM Node (e.g. <button>) and handle it in the controller
- extend from other controllers and inherit function, variables and logic

## What is it not
It is not a MVC JavaScript framework for client side applications like [Angular](https://www.angularjs.org/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), ...
It is not a abstraction layer for web components [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/).
