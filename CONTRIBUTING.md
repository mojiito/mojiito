# Contributing to Mojiito

We would love for you to contribute to Mojiito. As Mojiito is very similar to [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) and uses a lot of parts and ideas from it, it should be very easy to work on this project if you have experiences with Angular.

## Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests will follow).
- All public API methods must be documented. (Documentation needs work - Wanna contribute?).
- Code has to be successfully linted with tslint (Execute `npm run lint` in your command line tool)
